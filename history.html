			<p> Rome was founded around 625 BC in the areas of ancient Italy known as Etruria and Latium. The most famous legend regarding its founding is of two brothers, and demigods, Romulus and Remus. Apparently, in an argument over who would rule the city, Romulus killed Remus and named the city after himself. </p>
			<p> The first period in Roman history is known as the Period of Kings. These kings built a very successful military and economic base, which helped the Roman Empire prosper. When Rome entered its Republican Period, it was no longer ruled by kings. Instead it had established a new form of government, in which the higher class ruled (senators, equestrians, knights).</p>

			<p>Rome continued to expand through the Republican Period. Soon, Rome fell into war but was shifted to Imperialism began when Julius Caesar rose to power. By 51 BC, Julius Caesar had spread Romeâ€™s borders beyond the Mediterranean region, but was soon assassinated. In 31 BC, when Rome conquered Egypt, one of its leaders got killed. The remaining leader, Octavian, took the name Augustus and became the first emperor of Rome.</p>
			<p> During the Imperial Period (the last), the empire saw several decades of peace, prosperity, and expansion. By AD 117, the Roman Empire had reached its maximum and spanned almost three continents. A century later, the empire was split into two. Soon, the west suffered invasions and fell. The eastern empire, (Byzantine Empire) but fell when conquered by the Turks in AD 1453.</p>
