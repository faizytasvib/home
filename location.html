			<p>Rome is located in the Lazio Region of the country of Italy. The city itself is located in the central portion of the Italian peninsula and sits on the shore of the Tiber River about 15 miles (24 km) inland from the Tyrrhenian Sea. Since the city is bordered by the coastline, it is littered with numerous beaches of beautiful clear waters, and amazing views. The beaches are very popular throughout the year.</p>

		<h2> Climate </h2>
			<p>The city has a Mediterranean climate, really warm in the summer and not as cold in the winter. Though as you go inland, the weather is generally cooler and wetter but hot in the summer. However, since Rome is a coastline city its weather is generally very warm throughout the year (though, ups and down do take place). In winter however, the temperature drops down to 7 degrees and is usually colder at night. It rains a lot in the winter, with the occasional snow, however it is not that common. In summer the temperature can reach up to 30 degrees. </p>
